num=\"0001\">\n   The present invention relates to the field of technical vehicles and in particular to a hitch and lifting device for an agricultural implement, suitable for being mounted on an agricultural vehicle, and more particularly at the rear of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">\n   The present invention more particularly relates to the lateral adjustment of the position of the agricultural implements towed by a vehicle able to laterally vary the position of the implement in response to a geolocation signal so as to reliably maintain a preselected path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">\n   Agriculture developed in terms of precision thanks to the advent of navigation satellite systems such as GPS. By using a GPS facility, a farmer can thus locate a precise position in a field, which enables the farmed areas to be mapped with precision, according to a great number of parameters such as the yield of the crops, topography, organic matter content, moisture level, nitrogen rate, pH and others. Manufacturers of precision equipment started to supply automated steering systems which use GPS signals to steer an agricultural vehicle and especially a tractor, on a predetermined path. Although such equipment operate properly to guide the agricultural vehicle reliably and precisely, variations in soils and in topography limit the reliable and precise positioning of the towed implements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">\n   Several solutions to control geolocation of an agricultural implement towed to a tractor have been considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">\n   Such solutions are linked to the drawbar of the tractor or to both lower points of the rear hitch. These solutions consist in a fixed connection to the tractor by means of a drawbar or two or three fixing points, and an interface to move the implement transversally, as a function of the geolocation signal, in order for the implement to follow the same direction as the tractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">\n   According to a first approach, the moving interface of the implement makes the latter rotate around a vertical axis. In order to work, the rear hitch of the tractor must have a free swinging arm capacity. The implement must be fitted with a device engaged in the soil (essentially at least one disk) which produces a lateral force to move the implement in the desired direction. This correction system is however sensitive to the soil topology and to the ground declivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">\n   According to a second approach, the moving interface for the implement makes the latter translate laterally. In order to work, the rear hitch of the tractor must be locked, without a possible swinging arm. However, this type of solutions is not compatible with implements deeply engaged in the soil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">\n   One solution was then to fit the interface with anchors, against which a moving reaction is applied to move the working unit towards the side, whereas the rear hitch of the tractor has a free swinging arm capacity. These arrangements are however not applicable to implements with a low traction and with a low anchoring level in the soil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">\n   Another solution described in document WO2016041547A1 is to modify the hitch by varying the length of the arms by means of a jack in order to enable the rotation of the interface in addition to the translation of the implement. However, this solution requires the modification of standard hitches and induces a complex control of the simultaneous motions of the hitch and of the interface.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">\n   To sum up, there are guiding systems consisting in moving laterally the agricultural vehicle for the implement to follow the desired trajectory in spite of its shifts with respect to the vehicle. However, these systems are not adapted to the lateral instabilities which occur so quickly that the vehicle does not have time to counterbalance laterally, given its travel direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">\n   This is the reason why it has proven necessary to develop a solution which can adapt to the standards of agricultural vehicles without requiring a modification. It also seemed necessary for this solution to be compatible with implements with a great anchoring level in the soil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">\n   The principle is to move laterally the agricultural implement with respect to the agricultural vehicle to counterbalance the offset of the point of convergence so that the implement remains positioned with respect to its desired trajectory, and this, in spite of the lack of symmetry of the soil and of the relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">\n   Thus, the object of the invention is to move laterally the hitch, which the agricultural vehicle cannot do, while keeping the flexibility of a link enabling the self-alignment of the hitch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">\n   More precisely the object of the invention is a hitch device for an implement, suitable for being mounted on an agricultural vehicle, characterised in that it comprises:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">\n   a first chassis extending in a vertical plane, the normal of which is substantially the travel direction of the hitch,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">\n   a second chassis also extending in the vertical plane and translatably mounted on the first chassis along the transverse direction defined with respect to the travel direction of the hitch,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">\n   means (\n   <b>\n    82\n   </b>\n   ,\n   <b>\n    82\n   </b>\n   <i>\n    a,\n   </i>\n   <b>\n    82\n   </b>\n   <i>\n    b\n   </i>\n   ) for actuating the translation of the second chassis with respect to the first chassis,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\">\n   a device for fixing the first chassis at the rear of the agricultural vehicle,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\">\n   a system for hooking up an agricultural implement to the second chassis, said system being able to swivel freely around a vertical axis, with respect to the second chassis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\">\n   The hooking up device can comprise two hooking elements disposed at the lower part of the second chassis, symmetrically with respect to a median plane, said hooking elements extending along the opposite direction to the travel direction of the hitch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\">\n   The hooking elements located at the lower part of the second chassis can also be swivelling around an axis of the second chassis extending transversally, and retained by means of levelling rods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\">\n   The swivelling alpha angle of both hooking elements around the vertical axis can be between 0 and +/−30°, and preferably between 0 and +/−8°.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">\n   The hooking element swivelling around the vertical axis can be controlled by at least one jack, said at least one jack being able to work according to a first mode corresponding to the free rotation of the hooking elements around the vertical and a second mode in which the rotation of the hooking elements around the vertical is locked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">\n   The hooking up device can further comprise a third hooking element located at the upper part of the second chassis, said hooking element acting as a retaining element for the agricultural implement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\">\n   The fixing device of the first chassis at the rear of the agricultural vehicle can be a three-point lifting system including at the bottom part, two hinged arms mounted at one of their ends on an axis of the agricultural vehicle and at the other of their ends on the first chassis, and at the top part a linking element between the upper part of the first chassis and the agricultural vehicle, the arms being controlled by lifting means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\">\n   The second chassis can include two arms extending vertically and connected at their upper end by a body, their lower end being each slidably mounted along a pair of coaxial axes provided on the first chassis and extending in the vertical plane along the transverse direction, whereas the body of the second chassis is extended by a retaining element slidably mounted along an axis provided on the first chassis and also extending in the vertical plane along the transverse direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">\n   The second chassis can include two arms extending vertically and connected at their middle part by a body, their lower and upper ends being each respectively slidably mounted along a pair of coaxial axes provided on the first chassis and extending in the vertical plane along the transverse direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">\n   The means for actuating the translation of the second chassis with respect to the first chassis can comprise two single-acting jacks mounted on either side of the body of the second chassis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">\n   The means for actuating the translation of the second chassis with respect to the first chassis can comprise a double-acting jack mounted on one side of the second chassis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">\n   The free space between both arms of the second chassis can define a passage for the power cables of the means for actuating the translation of the second chassis with respect to the first chassis, as well as for the drive line driving the agricultural implement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">\n   The hitch device can further comprise a sensor to identify the position of the second chassis with respect to the first chassis.\n  </p>\n  <?summary-of-invention description=\"Summary of Invention\" end=\"tail\"?>\n  <?brief-description-of-drawings

Thus, when the second chassis performs a translation with respect to the first chassis, the swivelling enabled by the free motion of the hooking elements enables the translation to be performed without inducing a stress which would disturb the trajectory of the agricultural vehicle and without imposing excessive lateral stresses to the agricultural implement. The latter continuously self-balances during the offset motion of the second chassis and repositions itself on the desired trajectory without mechanical stresses disturbing the travel of the agricultural vehicle.

and in particular to a hitch and lifting device for an agricultural implement, suitable for being mounted on an agricultural vehicle, and more particularly at the rear of the vehicle.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0003', 'num': '0002'}\nThe present invention more particularly relates to the lateral adjustment of the position of the agricultural implements towed by a vehicle able to laterally vary the position of the implement in response to a geolocation signal so as to reliably maintain a preselected path.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0004', 'num': '0003'}\nAgriculture developed in terms of precision thanks to the advent of navigation satellite systems such as GPS. By using a GPS facility, a farmer can thus locate a precise position in a field, which enables the farmed areas to be mapped with precision, according to a great number of parameters such as the yield of the crops, topography, organic matter content, moisture level, nitrogen rate, pH and others. Manufacturers of precision equipment started to supply automated steering systems which use GPS signals to steer an agricultural vehicle and especially a tractor, on a predetermined path. Although such equipment operate properly to guide the agricultural vehicle reliably and precisely, variations in soils and in topography limit the reliable and precise positioning of the towed implements.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0005', 'num': '0004'}\nSeveral solutions to control geolocation of an agricultural implement towed to a tractor have been considered.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0006', 'num': '0005'}\nSuch solutions are linked to the drawbar of the tractor or to both lower points of the rear hitch. These solutions consist in a fixed connection to the tractor by means of a drawbar or two or three fixing points, and an interface to move the implement transversally, as a function of the geolocation signal, in order for the implement to follow the same direction as the tractor.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0007', 'num': '0006'}\nAccording to a first approach, the moving interface of the implement makes the latter rotate around a vertical axis. In order to work, the rear hitch of the tractor must have a free swinging arm capacity. The implement must be fitted with a device engaged in the soil (essentially at least one disk) which produces a lateral force to move the implement in the desired direction. This correction system is however sensitive to the soil topology and to the ground declivity.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0008', 'num': '0007'}\nAccording to a second approach, the moving interface for the implement makes the latter translate laterally. In order to work, the rear hitch of the tractor must be locked, without a possible swinging arm. However, this type of solutions is not compatible with implements deeply engaged in the soil.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0009', 'num': '0008'}\nOne solution was then to fit the interface with anchors, against which a moving reaction is applied to move the working unit towards the side, whereas the rear hitch of the tractor has a free swinging arm capacity. These arrangements are however not applicable to implements with a low traction and with a low anchoring level in the soil.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0010', 'num': '0009'}\nAnother solution described in document WO2016041547A1 is to modify the hitch by varying the length of the arms by means of a jack in order to enable the rotation of the interface in addition to the translation of the implement. However, this solution requires the modification of standard hitches and induces a complex control of the simultaneous motions of the hitch and of the interface.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0011', 'num': '0010'}\nTo sum up, there are guiding systems consisting in moving laterally the agricultural vehicle for the implement to follow the desired trajectory in spite of its shifts with respect to the vehicle. However, these systems are not adapted to the lateral instabilities which occur so quickly that the vehicle does not have time to counterbalance laterally, given its travel direction.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0012', 'num': '0011'}\nThis is the reason why it has proven necessary to develop a solution which can adapt to the standards of agricultural vehicles without requiring a modification. It also seemed necessary for this solution to be compatible with implements with a great anchoring level in the soil.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0013', 'num': '0012'}\nThe principle is to move laterally the agricultural implement with respect to the agricultural vehicle to counterbalance the offset of the point of convergence so that the implement remains positioned with respect to its desired trajectory, and this, in spite of the lack of symmetry of the soil and of the relief.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0014', 'num': '0013'}\nThus, the object of the invention is to move laterally the hitch, which the agricultural vehicle cannot do, while keeping the flexibility of a link enabling the self-alignment of the hitch.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0015', 'num': '0014'}\nMore precisely the object of the invention is a hitch

hooking elements \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0085', 'num': '0084'}\nAdvantageously, a further hooking element \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0086', 'num': '0085'}\nSo as to follow the swinging arm motions of the agricultural implement (these motions being inscribed in the horizontal plane), the hooking element \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0087', 'num': '0086'}\nIn the first embodiment as in the second embodiment, and in order to control the translation of the second chassis with respect to the first chassis accurately, the second chassis advantageously includes a feedback sensor C which enables the translation of the second chassis to be adjusted and the deviations to be corrected with respect to the set point position.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0088', 'num': '0087'}\nAdvantageously and such as represented in the first embodiment as in the second embodiment, the passage for the power cables of the actuating means \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0089', 'num': '0088'}\nThis free space can also advantageously be used for the passage of the mechanical drive line driving the agricultural implement and secondarily be used for the passage of hydraulic and/or electrical cables.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0090', 'num': '0089'}\nThus, both embodiments illustrate the principle of the invention which is precisely to move the second chassis with respect to the first chassis in order to reposition the agricultural implement with respect to the trajectory defined by the GPS system. The swivelling freedom of the hooking elements enables the transition of the agricultural implement during its repositioning and enables it to move forward without creating an abnormal lateral stress in the hitch and implement structures.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0091', 'num':

implement and the tractor enables the implement to be recentred on its line of balancing force and of pull without imposing a rigidity stress which would be detrimental to the capacity of the tractor to maintain its trajectory, including in the curves or the slopes.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0093', 'num': '0092'}\nFurthermore this layout prevents the transmission to the agricultural vehicle of the lateral pulses related to the lacks of symmetry of the relief or of the pull force.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np\n{'id': 'p-0094', 'num':
